# CAProject
Upload(Backup) our Verilog HDL Code which consists RISC-V processor and RISC-V Program

## Project Goal
- Make our own RISC-V processor using Verilog HDL.
- Take an advantage of running RISC-V program at short time.
- Improve software's algorithm fitting our processor.

## Environment
- Tool : Xilinx Vivado 2020.2
- FPGA : Libertron Artix-7

## Notice!!
- Please update your code before you modified our code.
- Do NOT make build directly. (Must use Fork)
- Write Patch Note thoroughly.
